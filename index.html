      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi! I'm Amanda and I have no idea what I'm doing. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Kissimmee, FL, originally. But I grew up in metro Atlanta and have called the city my home for the past 8 years.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Eating, reading, annihilating my husband at Mario Kart or Super Smash Bros, and hanging out with our kitties, Brewster and Reggie</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My childhood dream was to be a veterinarian. But at this point in my life, I'd probably consider any job that pays well and gives me a sense of fulfillment to be my "dream job." </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Decatur, GA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Hopefully to be able to acquire one of those elusive dream jobs! It's my goal to be able to create a challenging, secure, and profitable career path for myself by completing this boot camp.</p>
